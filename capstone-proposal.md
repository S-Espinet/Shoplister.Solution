* _search database for pre-existing item before creating a new one_  

**What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.**

* _C#_
* _CSS_
* _MySQL_
* _.NET 5.0_  

**If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.**

* _extra styling_
* _hosting_
* _import items from other sites (Google shopping list, AllRecipes, etc.)_
* _option to organize items by category (produce, dairy, etc.)_
* _responsive display_  

**What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?**

* _Bootstrap_
* _Google API, AllRecipes API_  

**Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?**   
	There is a good chance I will need to change course and make a C#-based MVC application.
