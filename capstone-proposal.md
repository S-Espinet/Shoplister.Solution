**Name of Student:** Sarah Espinet 
  
**Name of Project:** Shoplister
  
**Project's Purpose of Goal** *(What will it do for users?)***:**   
I have used Google's shopping list web app for a couple of years now. It's functional, but it allows duplicate items to be added. This is frustrating, so this is a shopping list app that won't allow duplicate entries.   
Shoplister will allow users to create a shopping list. They will have the ability to create items and organize them by store, as well as check off, delete, and update items.  
  
**List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:**

* _CRUD functionality_
* _create relationships between stores and items to organize items by store_
* _search database for pre-existing item before creating a new one_  

**What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.**

* _C#_
* _CSS_
* _MySQL_
* _.NET 5.0_  

**If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.**

* _extra styling_
* _hosting_
* _import items from other sites (Google shopping list, AllRecipes, etc.)_
* _option to organize items by category (produce, dairy, etc.)_
* _responsive display_  

**What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?**

* _Bootstrap_
* _Microsoft Azure - or- Firebase -or- other hosting service_
* _Google API, AllRecipes API_  

**Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?**   
	I would have made a React.js - based application if I'd had more time to study React.
