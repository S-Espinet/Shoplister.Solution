 	* As a user, I want to be able to check items off as I have acquired them, and move them into a separate list for checked-off items.
 	* As a user, I want to be able to have notes for each item where I can include a quantity or specific brand.
 	* As a user, I want to be able to update my item, its store, and its details.
 	* As a user, I want the option to delete an item permanently.
 	* As a user, I want to be able to click on a store, and see the items that I plan to purchase at that store.
 	* As a user, when I add an item, I want the application to check to see if it already exists, and if it does, move the item from the checked-off items list to the current active list.  

* **Stretch Goals User Stories**  
 	* As a user, I want to further organize items by category, as well as by store.
